## Reconciliation census

This repository hosts a collaborative census of the reconciliation ecosystem: available services, clients, libraries, documented uses, and anything else we need to be aware of when drafting formal specifications for an improved protocol.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/reconciliation-api/census/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
